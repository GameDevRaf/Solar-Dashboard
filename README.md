# Solar Dashboard
 This project is about getting data from a Solar Inverter and then Sending it to Grafana ( Through MQTT ).
 
 In the end, I couldn't get the data from the Inverter because the Inverter I was using was unsupported.
 So it didn't work for me, but hopefully you find some use out of it!
 
 Note: The Code in here is not mine, it is taken from softwarecrash/Solar2MQTT and BMBIT-oss/Solar2MQTT_P18. Check out thier repository's for more information an how to set it up.
